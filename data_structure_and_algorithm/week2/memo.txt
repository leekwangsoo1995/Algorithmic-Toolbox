memo:
    Started 2week lesson.
    I learned:
        Naive Fibonacchi(used recursive function)
        Efficient Fibonacchi(used recursive, but preserved former variables)
        Naive Greatest common divisor(calculate one by one)
        Effficient Greatest common divisor(used euclid function)
        What is Big O Notation.(Processing time is depends on machine.That's why people use Big O Notation.)
        Tried algorithms on site.(https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/ungradedLab/Qmv41/big-o-notation-plots/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2Fbigo.ipynb%23Big-O-Notation%3A-Plots)
