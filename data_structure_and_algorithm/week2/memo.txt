memo:
    Started 2week lesson.
    I learned:
        Naive Fibonacchi(used recursive function)
        Efficient Fibonacchi(used recursive, but preserved former variables)
        Naive Greatest common divisor(calculate one by one)
        Effficient Greatest common divisor(used euclid function)
        What is Big O Notation.(Processing time is depends on machine.That's why people use Big O Notation.)
